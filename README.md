# MobileAppTwentyThree
This is a mobile game I created in the Mobile Application course.
This game is similar to the card game Twenty-One. I changed some of the rules to create a new game. 
The goal of the game is to get as close to -23 or 23 as possible without going over. 
The game can also be won by getting a card of any suit with the value of two for the first card and a card of any suit with the value of three for the second card.
Red cards have negative point values. Black cards have positive point values.
Both the user and the computer start out with two cards. The user is able to discard and redraw up to three cards. When a user discards
a card, he is automatically given a new card. To discard a card, just touch the card. A message will be displayed asking the user if he wants to discard the card.
The user is only allowed to have at the most seven cards on the table. Once the user has seven cards on the table and he has discarded and redrawn 
three times, his turn is automatically over. His turn is also automatically over if he busts. The computer is able to draw up to an additional eight cards.
When it is the computer\'s turn, it has to continue to draw until its points are above 17 or it has busted or it has reached the draw limit.
